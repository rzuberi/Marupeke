# Marupeke
Marupeke is a grid-based game where you essentially play Tic-Tac-Toe against yourself.

This was a first year Java school project done in 3 parts.

With this GUI you can:
- play the Marupeke game with a random grid from size 3x3 to 10x10
- play the Marupeke game with a grid you can build on the GUI from size 3x3 to 10x10
- play the Marupeke game with a grid you imported
- save a grid while playing
- see where you made a mistake in real time
- play around with the solving algorithm.
